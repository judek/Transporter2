Yes you can send binary data using XHR. All you need to do is set the appropriate headers and mime-type, and call the sendAsBinary method instead of the simple send method. For example:

var req = new XMLHttpRequest();  
req.open("POST", url, true);  
// set headers and mime-type appropriately  
req.setRequestHeader("Content-Length", 741);  
req.sendAsBinary(aBody);


=============================================
I recently had the need to send a CSV file from my add-on to a PHP server and was looking for an easier way than constructing a POST request. I discovered that XMLHttpRequest has an API for this called sendAsBinary(). Using the API on the client side was easy, but figuring out how to get the file from PHP was a little tougher, so I thought I would share the information on my blog.
Sending the data is really straightforward. I already had the CSV file in a variable. So the request looked like this:

var xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();
xhr.open("POST", "http://example.com/upload.php");
xhr.overrideMimeType('text/plain; charset=x-user-defined-binary');
xhr.sendAsBinary(CSV);
